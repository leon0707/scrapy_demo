"Techniques are provided for determining predicted results for entities based on relatedness of the entities in a graph of nodes. In an embodiment, the graph of nodes is generated based on the determined relatedness of the entities. A node in the graph of nodes represents an entity, and nodes representing entities with known results are assigned those results as their respective node values. The assigned node values are then propagated between the neighboring nodes throughout the graph of nodes in the amount determined by the relatedness of the nodes. Based on the propagation, node values for entities with unknown results are determined and represent the predicted results for those entities. Additionally, various classifiers may be combined with the propagated node values to increase the accuracy of the predicted results.",LinkedIn Corporation,"09/03/2019, 12:53:42","February 18, 2016","August 20, 2019","Qiang Zhu, John Chao, Qingbo Hu",https://patents.justia.com/company/linkedin,10387788,Graph based techniques for predicting results,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/10387788

"An online computer system including a database uses an encrypted table that allows for write protection its contents. Middleware logic operating on the system acts as an interface for access to the database, so that any business logic on the system accesses the database through simple procedural calls to the middleware rather than directly to the database itself. The middleware logic abstracts logic that helps implement write protection with the encrypted table. Data to be encrypted that has been traditionally written to other tables is migrated to the encrypted table, where the data encrypted using an authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithm. To implement AEAD, the original table, column, and primary key indicating where the data would have otherwise been stored are together used as additional authenticated data (AAD). This tuple of information is also stored in the encrypted table.","Airbnb, Inc.","09/03/2019, 12:53:43","December 12, 2018","March 12, 2019","Ismail Cem Paya, Nelson Aurel Gauthier, Kevin Nguyen",https://patents.justia.com/assignee/airbnb-inc,10229286,Database encryption to provide write protection,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/10229286
"A computer implemented system and method for selecting and notifying operators of the option to enable a record activation feature for a short interval of time for the records they offer in a selected geographic area. Enabling record activation for a record indicates that the record may be booked by a user without first requesting the operator to manually approve the transaction request and waiting for the operator's approval of the request. Before selecting and notifying operators, a demand for database requests is predicted. Operators that are most likely to offer their record for record activation are identified. A quality score is determined for each identified record based on the likelihood that the record will get booked once the operator has programmatically enabled record activation. The records needed to fulfill the demand for database requests are selected based on their quality score and the operators of the selected records are notified of the option to enable record activation.","Airbnb, Inc.","09/03/2019, 12:53:43","December 12, 2018","February 12, 2019","Spencer de Mars, Kim Pham, Maxim Charkov",https://patents.justia.com/assignee/airbnb-inc,10204144,Automated database record activation using predictive modeling of database access,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/10204144

For a selected content item and identified target recipients of the item, when a user initiates a message to forward or otherwise convey the content item, one or more schemes are applied to select and automatically populate the message with suitable addressees. In one scheme, values are computed for each neighbor of the sender, to indicate the value of delivering the item to that neighbor; the message is automatically addressed to the highest-value neighbors. In another scheme, user communities that encompass the target recipients are identified and the message is automatically addressed to neighbors that are best able to disseminate the item throughout a community.

"High-precision local search is performed on the Internet. A map image-rendering software provider embeds spatial keys into maps, which are then provided to producers of Internet content such as map providers. For example, a homeowner may post a message on a web bulletin board advertising his house for sale, and including a map showing the location of the house. When a search engine's web crawler encounters a page having a spatial key embedded in an image, the spatial key is indexed with the other content on the page. Because the spatial key identifies a small geographic area, indexing the content with the spatial key allows search queries to be limited by area and still provide useful results. Thus, a user of a search engine searching for “house for sale” in a specific area will be directed to web pages that meet the geographic and content search terms.","UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","09/03/2019, 12:53:49","August 30, 2016","September 4, 2018","Richard F.

The lane guidance at a position along the navigation route scores the lanes and provides the lane scoring for the user. To score the lanes, the navigation system determines a lane distance for each lane indicating how far along the navigation route a user may continue to use this lane, without shifting to another lane. The lane distance may be measured up to a look-ahead distance. The lane distance includes distance along subsequent road segments of the route, such that when a lane turns onto a lane on another road segment according to the navigation route, the distance along the other road may be included in the lane distance.","UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","09/03/2019, 12:53:53","March 18, 2016","April 3, 2018",Seth Alan Woolley,https://patents.justia.com/assignee/uber-technologies-inc?page=11,9933272,Navigation lane guidance,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/9933272

A large Partition-by-Query index may be partitioned across multiple servers depending on the size of the index, or the size of the index may be reduced by compressing query-references pairs into clusters. The methods and systems described herein may provide suggestions and spelling corrections to the user, thereby improving the user's geo-search engine experience while meeting user expectations for geo-search quality and responsiveness.","Uber Technologies, Inc.","09/03/2019, 12:53:57","December 22, 2015","October 20, 2015",Geoffrey Hendrey,https://patents.justia.com/assignee/uber-technologies-inc?page=16,9165074,Systems and methods for performing geo-search and retrieval of electronic point-of-interest records using a big index,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/9165074
"A routing module identifies POIs that can be reached from a route with a cost less than distance m. A routing engine performs a reverse exploration on nodes in the planned route to locate POIs from which the route can be reached with a cost of less than a second cost n. POIs identified as being reachable from the route with a cost of less than m, and from which the route is reachable with a cost less than n are then further filtered to identify a subset of the POIs for which the sum of the time or distance from the route to the POI and the time or distance from the POI back to the route is less than a threshold time or distance, t.","Uber Technologies, Inc.","09/03/2019, 12:53:57","December 22, 2015","October 6, 2015","Richard F.

"High-precision local search is performed on the Internet. A map image-rendering software provider embeds spatial keys into maps, which are then provided to producers of Internet content such as map providers. For example, a homeowner may post a message on a web bulletin board advertising his house for sale, and including a map showing the location of the house. When a search engine's web crawler encounters a page having a spatial key embedded in an image, the spatial key is indexed with the other content on the page. Because the spatial key identifies a small geographic area, indexing the content with the spatial key allows search queries to be limited by area and still provide useful results. Thus, a user of a search engine searching for “house for sale” in a specific area will be directed to web pages that meet the geographic and content search terms.","Uber Technologies, Inc.","09/03/2019, 12:53:57","June 25, 2012","September 15, 2015","Geoffrey R.
